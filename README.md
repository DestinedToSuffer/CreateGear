**CreateGear brings new tools to your gameplay experience. Using Create, this mod expands the possibilities of crafting and introduces advanced tools to the game.**

In CreateGear, you'll discover five unique tools that offer enhanced capabilities and durability compared to their vanilla counterparts. These tools are designed to empower players with superior mining, excavation, farming, wood cutting, and combat abilities, providing an exciting edge in their adventures. 

## Special Thanks to...
Tinkers Construct for the inspirations and my favorite mod Create!

# **THIS MOD REQUIRES CREATE(0.5.1a) TO BE INSTALLED TO WORK**
